# Social Finance

A financial system that runs on top of a social currency.

ZeroDAO wants to give a unique and optimal definition to social currency. We believe that social currency is not just a general concept, but a practical underlying economy for web 3.0 social networks. It does not invent something new, but rather the digitisation of human social value and social interaction.
