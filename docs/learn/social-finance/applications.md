# Application guide 

## Creator Economy

Not all creator economy products should use ICSC or traditional monetary models, and specific models should be carefully considered. However, one principle is certain: ICSC should be used decisively when content incentives may have a negative effect. Some common contribution models are listed below, with corresponding analysis and recommendations.

- **Reading time** - The user is rewarded with a Token for reading a certain amount of time, this model uses ICSC as much as possible.
- **Fiction** - Paid subscriptions and copyrighted fiction platforms should not use ICSC.
- **Information flow** - Traditional social networking information flow models, such as Twitter and Facebook type applications, must use ICSC.
- **Podcasts** - ICSC should be the main focus, supplemented by models such as ad share.

## Advertising platforms

Traditional blockchain advertising settles attention into Tokens, evolving blockchain advertising into incentive advertising in an extremely narrow scenario. This would evolve into users watching ads in order to get Token, while advertisers need potential customers interested in the product, a paradox that dictates that traditional decentralized advertising platforms cannot be applied at scale. But if the rewards were changed to the ICSC model it would become feasible.
