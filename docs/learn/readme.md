# Introduction

ZeroDAO Network is a DAO network belonging to all Web3 (or Metaverse) builders. The goal of all network mechanisms of ZeroDAO Network is to ensure sustainable and high-intensity innovation while maintaining a fair distribution of resources.

## Ideal

### Rational and elegant

The name of ZeroDAO comes from a formula: 0º = 1. We hope to continuously create new possibilities from zero to one in a rational and elegant way.

###  Reality interface

The ZeroDAO Network is an interface connecting the Web3 and reality. We cleverly map the real world to the digital world (Web3 or metaverse).Continue to build better collaboration models and distribution mechanisms, and further promote the progress of the real world.

## Contribution

ZeroDAO collaborates entirely in DAO mode.We lock most of the tokens in DAO, and ZeroDAO Network belongs to those creative and passionate community members.

###  Research

The development of ZeroDAO Network requires tireless research. From the underlying TIR algorithm, to the collaboration and incentive mechanism of DAO, to the design of Dapp, it needs the promotion of economics, sociology, cybernetics, cryptography and other disciplines theories.。

### Application protocol

Create or improve the application layer protocol, or participate in the discussion, so that the application layer protocol supports the application ecosystem to better collaborate.

### Application

Don't worry about your ideas being too crazy, let the crazy ideas eventually become products that people are accustomed to, this is exactly what we are doing. Based on social networks and reputation system, ZeroDAO will comprehensively promote the application of Web3 and Metaverse. You can collaborate through the DAO to come up with an idea for broader discussion and support, or you can make a thoughtful proposal to request collaboration, or you and your team can directly create an application.
